maturity_target,The time-to-expiry target for options selection
mu,The mean of the MPD;  mu = sum(probability at ln-return x * ln-return x)
sd,The standard deviation of the MPD;  sd = sqrt(sum(probability at ln-return x * (ln-return x - mu)^2))
skew,The skew of the MPD;  skew = sum(probability at ln-return x * (ln-return x - mu)^3)/(sd^3)
kurt,The kurtosis of the MPD;  kurt = sum(probability at ln-return x * (ln-return x - mu)^4)/(sd^4)-3
p10,The 10th percentile of the MPD
p50,The 50th percentile of the MPD
p90,The 90th percentile of the MPD
lg_change_prob,"The change in the expected return in percentage terms defined as ""large"""
prDec,"The probability of a ""large decline"" in return as defined by ""lg_change_prob"""
prInc,"The probability of a ""large increase"" in return as defined by ""lg_change_prob"""
